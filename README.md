Kali Linux commands for penetration tests

Installing Kali Linux can be done in several ways, including as a primary operating system, a virtual machine, or alongside another OS (dual booting). Below is a step-by-step guide for each method. Before proceeding, it's important to ensure you have backed up any important data and that your system meets the necessary requirements.

Prerequisites

1. System Requirements:
   - Minimum 2 GB RAM (4 GB or more recommended)
   - Minimum 20 GB disk space (more is better)
   - Processor can be either 32-bit or 64-bit.
   
2. Bootable Media:
   - A DVD or USB drive (at least 8 GB).
   
3. Kali Linux ISO:
   - Download the latest Kali Linux ISO from the official [Kali Linux download page](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).

Method 1: Install Kali Linux on a Physical Machine

Step 1: Create Bootable USB/DVD

1. Using Rufus (Windows):
   - Download and run [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).
   - Insert your USB drive.
   - Select the USB drive in Rufus.
   - Select the downloaded Kali ISO file.
   - Click "Start" to create the bootable USB.

2. Using dd (Linux):
   - Open a terminal.
   - Identify your USB drive using lsblk.
   - Use the following command (replace /dev/sdX with your USB drive):
     `bash
     sudo dd if=kali-linux-2023.x.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
     `

Step 2: Boot from USB/DVD

1. Restart your computer.
2. Access BIOS/UEFI settings (typically with F2, F10, F12, or DEL).
3. Change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive or DVD.
4. Save settings and exit.

Step 3: Install Kali Linux

1. When Kali Linux boots, you will see a splash screen. Press Enter to select "Install".
2. Choose your language, region, and keyboard layout.
3. Configure your network settings (optional, enter a hostname and domain name).
4. Create a user account and set a password.
5. Partition your disk:
   - Use guided partitioning if you're unsure, or select manual if you need control over the partition layout.
   - If dual-booting, be careful not to overwrite existing partitions.
6. Follow the installation prompts, selecting packages and configuring the system as needed.
7. Once installation is complete, reboot the system and remove the USB/DVD when prompted.

Method 2: Install Kali Linux in Virtual Machine

Step 1: Install Virtualization Software

- VMware Workstation / Player: Download and install from the [VMware site](https://vmware.com).
- Oracle VirtualBox: Download from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine

1. Open your virtualization software.
2. Create a new VM and select the downloaded Kali Linux ISO as the boot disk.
3. Allocate at least 2 GB RAM and create a virtual disk of at least 20 GB.
4. Follow the specific instructions for your virtualization software.

Step 3: Install Kali Linux

1. Boot the newly created VM.
2. Follow the same steps as the physical installation above to install Kali.

Method 3: Dual Boot Kali Linux alongside another OS

1. Follow the creating bootable USB/DVD steps above.
2. In the partitioning step during installation, select to create space for Kali alongside your existing operating system.
3. Finish the installation. At reboot, you should see a GRUB menu allowing you to select between your existing OS and Kali Linux.

Post-Installation

1. Update Kali: 
   After installation, run the following commands in the terminal:
   `bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   `

2. Additional Tools:
   Depending on what you need, you may want to install additional tools from the Kali repositories.
